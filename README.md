WDD130: Front-end 
This repository showcases my very first front-end web development project, created as part of the WDD130 course. The project is a simple "White Water Rafting - Portal" website, designed to introduce fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS.

ðŸŒŠ Project Description
The "White Water Rafting - Portal" project serves as an introductory exercise to web development. It demonstrates basic web page structuring using HTML and styling with CSS. The goal was to create a static website that provides information about white water rafting, acting as a portal for potential adventurers.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling the visual presentation of the website, including layout, colors, and typography.

âœ¨ Features
Basic Page Structure: Demonstrates the use of common HTML elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.

Styling with CSS: Application of external CSS to control fonts, colors, spacing, and basic page layout.

Navigation: Simple navigation links to different sections or pages (if applicable, depending on the project scope).

Responsive Design : While an introductory project, some basic responsiveness might be implemented to ensure readability on different screen sizes.

The project concluded: https://thneri95.github.io/wdd130/wwr/index.html
