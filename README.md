## 📚 Course Overview

WDD 130 introduces the essential tools for building static websites: **HTML** and **CSS**. This project—my very first front-end build—represents the application of those fundamentals in the form of a simple, elegant website for a fictional white water rafting company.

The focus of the course was:
- Structuring web content using semantic HTML
- Styling and layout through CSS
- Understanding responsive principles and clean code practices

## 🌐 Project Overview: White Water Rafting Portal

The goal of this introductory project was to simulate a business homepage that showcases basic content layout, user-friendly navigation, and clean visual styling. While simple, the website effectively introduces principles of structure, consistency, and readability.

### 📌 What This Site Includes:
- A **Home Page** introducing the rafting experience
- **About Us** section giving company background
- **Trips Page** listing options and destinations
- **Contact Page** with a form and contact info

💡 What I Learned
📐 How to lay out a consistent website using semantic HTML

🎨 How to organize and apply styles using external stylesheets

🧱 The importance of visual hierarchy and content spacing

🔗 Internal vs. external linking and file structure best practices

📲 Responsive design basics (viewport meta tag, flexible widths)

🧭 Next Steps & Growth
This project marks my first milestone in front-end development. From here, I plan to:

Learn and integrate JavaScript for interactivity

Explore CSS Grid and Flexbox for more complex layouts

Begin working with form validation and basic back-end handling

Enhance mobile responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG practices)


✅ Summary
This project is simple—but it represents the foundation of everything I’ll build in the future. It’s the first step on my journey as a front-end and full-stack developer. Every line of HTML and CSS here is a brick in the digital structures I’ll design tomorrow.
